Happy New Year! The README on the current tooling that I imagine most are using mentions a direct upgrade if you were using the mongoless tag which, due to what&amp;rsquo;s colloquially known as &amp;ldquo;Sod&amp;rsquo;s Law&amp;rdquo;, I am not.
On the new repo as well as the DockerHub page, the docs currently have a brief mentioning of requiring an external MongoDB instance but the code snippits don&amp;rsquo;t actuall have one&amp;hellip; This seemed a little problematic, and after migrating my setup last night, figured I&amp;rsquo;d include a quick walkthrough.</description></item></channel></rss>
